# README

This application was created for a few reasons:

- To help me learn Rails
- To give me more experience using Git/GitHub
- To give me a better version of my Backlog Dreadsheet

My goals with this are to create a simple app that:

- Allows me to share my list with others
- Allows me to log in to the app in order to add/update games
- Allows me to sort in a way that makes the most sense
